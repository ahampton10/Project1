## Description: 
We created an application for basketball fans to purchase tickets and look-up stats. 
## Motivation: 
We wanted to ensure that Blake’s portfolio stayed consistent with his basketball theme. We also wanted a user friendly platform to present information to an end user on basketball. 
## Result: 
Users can easily access statistics on their favorite teams and purchase tickets. 
## Team Efforts: 
We’ve been very collaborative. Blake and Nicole mostly worked on front end. Alex did her best to work on the back end, but ultimately we all came together because we only had 3 group members. 
## Individual Responsibilities: 
* Blake- Main presenter and styling 
* Alex- Javascript and APIs
* Nicole- Researched and implemented new framework (Materialize) and HTML. 
## Challenges: 
Division of responsibilities was challenging due to lack of team members. Had an evening in which Blake and Alex were unable to meet, leaving us one project day short. 
## Improvements: 
In the future we would like to have more team features on the site such as live feeds, videos, etc. 
## Technologies Used: 
Jquery, Materialize, Ticketmaster API, All Sports API
